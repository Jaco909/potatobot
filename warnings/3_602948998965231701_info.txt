Would love to see how you made it better, but I unfortunately can't

I mean, its just a status. I use my status for daily jokes and shit so i wouldnt think much of it, but just in case, i changed my status to something else for the day

:oh_no:
 
MinceToday at 7:16 PM
a) its not a message b) that rule is for porn, controversial messages that will start a shit storm and detract from the nature of the discord, and messages that contain racist remarks etc
using "adult words" isnt against the rules unless you want us to become youtube
 
Hell-metToday at 7:19 PM
loophole but ok

death34Today at 7:21 PM
most of the time discord rules are always up to the discretion of the discord moderators
 
MinceToday at 7:21 PM
youre complaining about a joke in someone's status (not our discord chat) which could at most, be considered lightly offensive if you dont get the reference
 
Hell-metToday at 7:21 PM
if you say so
