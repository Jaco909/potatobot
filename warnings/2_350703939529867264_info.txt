Personally, given how Ventri usualy acts, plus how coy he was about what they posted if your defence is meme faces, then you know what you did is wrong, that warning stays.
The fact that he had to have a wikipedia page ready to defend his post just signals that he's looking for attention.

they posted it with full intention knowing what it looked like
