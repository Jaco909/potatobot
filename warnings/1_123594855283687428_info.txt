Can you guys imagine getting banned for playing medic in MvM

interrobangToday at 12:01 AM
If you're who I think you are, you were banned due to collaborating with a cheating friend on our servers.

LDToday at 12:03 AM
So what is the problem here? Playing medic or adding people to your friends list when they carry you through missions? I don't get how this is some awful offence when I never cheated.
why am I getting punished also
idk I just wanna play MvM
 
interrobangToday at 12:06 AM
The staff will discuss the ban and get back to you tomorrow.
 
LDToday at 12:06 AM
yeah I didn't expect anything instant since I'm a late night gamer anyways, it's midnight EST rn
 
BotRotToday at 12:07 AM
were you aware that this friend of yours was cheating and did you encourage him to continue?
 
LDToday at 12:08 AM
Well I think everybody was aware of it lol
Also we weren't friends before
Iv'e played 13 missions and only did two of them with him
 
interrobangToday at 12:15 AM
@LD We've discovered that you've been friends with this guy on his main account for over 200 days and have concluded that you did not in fact just meet him today. You'll remain banned.
 
LDToday at 12:16 AM
What main account
I added that aimbotter that day
 
interrobangToday at 12:17 AM

LDToday at 12:20 AM
So what do I have to do a background check on all 194 of my steam friends before I play on a community server next time to make sure none of them are on an alt account?
Seems kinda ridiculous to me
Were any of the other players in that server banned for helping him other than the heavy who reported it?
 
interrobangToday at 12:22 AM
Our argument here is that you've been friends with the cheater before you joined our server, and used him to help complete the campaign. We were going to unban you after discovering you added him only a day ago until we found out you had him added on his main for 200 days.
I don't believe anybody else in the server was friends with him previously.
 
LDToday at 12:23 AM
Well how do you expect me to know about both these accounts being the same person though?
 
interrobangToday at 12:23 AM
Cheating by proxy is against the rules; if it wasn't, people could just use their friends to do what you just did -- cheat and help them complete their tour without reprocussions.
 
LDToday at 12:24 AM
I don't check all my friends accounts
 
interrobangToday at 12:24 AM
Because both of their names were/are "shoobies". I'm sorry but we aren't going to believe that you coincidentally ran into your friend who was cheating on an alt account, and that you were ignorant of that fact.
 
LDToday at 12:24 AM
I wasn't cheating
 
interrobangToday at 12:24 AM
It should have been obvious to you even if you're telling the truth.
Cheating by proxy means using someone else to cheat for you.
 
LDToday at 12:25 AM
The other one's name is shoobs and wasn't before also

theAgamer11Today at 12:26 AM
Additionally, you admitted you knew he was cheating and you added him to your friends list, which implies that even if you didn’t know him before, you were supportive of his cheating.
 
LDToday at 12:26 AM
Personally I don't like being punished for other people's actions
Additionally, when I play with good players I add them, that's why I have 194 people on my list
 
A WandererToday at 12:27 AM
and you consider an aimbotting player to be a "good" player?
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:27 AM
“Well I think everybody was aware of it lol” - you
You knew he wasn’t good; you knew he was cheating.
 
LDToday at 12:28 AM
did I just say that I think he wasn't cheating?
Can you please not put words in my mouth okay
 
interrobangToday at 12:28 AM
Additionally, when I play with good players I add them
we're getting into semantics but here you implied you thought he was just a good player
 
LDToday at 12:29 AM
well by definition, if having him on the team makes the mission easier, he is good
 
A WandererToday at 12:29 AM
...
 
LDToday at 12:29 AM
but now were going into semantic stupid shit
 
interrobangToday at 12:29 AM
and yet you thought "everybody was aware [that he was cheating]"
“Well I think everybody was aware of it lol” 
 
LDToday at 12:29 AM
everybody was
 
interrobangToday at 12:29 AM
so you didn't think he was just a skilled player
 
LDToday at 12:29 AM
where did I say that I thought he wasn't cheating
I said he helped me complete the mission
 
interrobangToday at 12:30 AM
here we go again
 
LDToday at 12:30 AM
Which, for me, is good
I am not cheating, I'm benefiting from someone else cheating
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:30 AM
So what you're trying to convince us here is that you think cheating is good? Correct me if I'm wrong.
 
LDToday at 12:30 AM
it'd be like getting an australium from somebody aimbotting in two cities
 
A WandererToday at 12:31 AM
no matter where you're coming from, cheating is uncool and frankly--rather boring
 
LDToday at 12:31 AM
If that player gets VAC banned, I shouldn't also get my aussie taken away
that's dumb
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:31 AM
"I am not cheating, I'm benefiting from someone else cheating"
Also, see interro's above mention of cheating by proxy.
 
LDToday at 12:31 AM
I played the game legitimately
 
interrobangToday at 12:32 AM
If you read our instruction manual you'd see that we reserve the right to ban people from the campaign for any reason -- this reason is you cheating by proxy and using a friend to help complete your tours.
This is our final decision and this conversation is over.
 
MinceToday at 12:32 AM
You're skewing the results of the community driven contracts by aiding a cheater
 
interrobangToday at 12:32 AM
https://hydrogen-mvm.github.io/Madness/pdf/Campaign.pdf
 
LDToday at 12:32 AM
But I did not do that
 
interrobangToday at 12:33 AM
Disclaimers: The admins of the campaign reserve the right to do any of the following:
•Up to Oct 31st, 2019: Increase or decrease the contract requirements (if needed).
•After Oct 31st, 2019: Decrease contract requirements (if needed). No increases will be made.
•Remove and ban players from the event for any reason, including but not limited to cheating.
 
LDToday at 12:33 AM
So why am I banned if I didn't do the thing I was banned for?
 
yoshimoToday at 12:33 AM
cheating by proxy is still cheating, just like being an accomplice to a crime still makes you a criminal
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:33 AM
Consider it accessory to cheating if you will. If you willingly provide a place for criminals to plan a theft, you are still partially accountable for that theft, even if you were not actually stealling anything.
 
LDToday at 12:34 AM
Is that just a dumb way to say "You played medic and healed a cheater so you are a cheater"
I'm not helping him cheat
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:34 AM
Medic has literally nothing to do with this.
 
LDToday at 12:34 AM
I didn't give him the cheat program or tell him to use it
or give him items in TF2 to use
 
interrobangToday at 12:34 AM
Banned him, move on.
 
Fat CJToday at 12:34 AM
cough vote kick
 
interrobangToday at 12:34 AM
Nothing more needs to be said.
 
A WandererToday at 12:35 AM
omission/failure to say anything about said cheating could still count as being an accomplice, that is the last thing I'm saying
most of the time
 
MinceToday at 12:36 AM
no
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:36 AM
Nah, that gets too complicated to enforce.
 
MinceToday at 12:36 AM
that has nothing to do with this
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:36 AM
Plus would include too many people.
Bystander effect and all that.
 
A WandererToday at 12:36 AM
true
 
MinceToday at 12:36 AM
thats some communist government ass rules right there
the point was he lied about just adding him, when theyve been friends for 200+ days

*Admin Log*

interrobangToday at 12:06 AM
@Prejudge  @Campaign Judge  guy in #help_support was banned due to a tip off from peli that he was collaborating with a cheater on our servers by pocketing him
do we keep him banned
 
BraindawgToday at 12:06 AM
yes
 
gettysburgToday at 12:06 AM
yep
 
interrobangToday at 12:06 AM
apparently he only just added him to his friends list
they weren't friends before
steamid.co.uk proves this
 
gettysburgToday at 12:08 AM
unless he was completely braindead he knew he was helping a cheater
 
MinceToday at 12:08 AM
regardless why are we policing this
ban the hacker and leave it at that
 
interrobangToday at 12:08 AM
because he can argue that we should have banned everyone else on his server too
 
MinceToday at 12:08 AM
thats my point
 
interrobangToday at 12:08 AM
which is a valid argument
 
MinceToday at 12:09 AM
no idea what you guys were doing on that one
 
interrobangToday at 12:09 AM
then we can just say oh you were pocketing a cheater and you knew he was cheating
then he would say
so only pocketing cheaters will get you banned
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:09 AM
Watch the demo and see if there’s anything proving he was corroberating with the sniper
 
JakaToday at 12:09 AM
How recently did he add the cheater to his friends list?
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:09 AM
like text
 
interrobangToday at 12:09 AM
literally like 24 hours ago
about the time of the incident
apparently
 
JakaToday at 12:10 AM
yeah, that's really sus in my book
 
gettysburgToday at 12:10 AM
probably just unban him since it was a recent add
 
MinceToday at 12:10 AM
does it really matter though
like i said we dont police servers
 
interrobangToday at 12:10 AM
well it does
 
gettysburgToday at 12:10 AM
watch the demo if you really want to
but prob not worth the time
 
interrobangToday at 12:10 AM
if he was friends with the guy and they planned to join our servers and cheat
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:10 AM
It’s accessory to cheating.
 
interrobangToday at 12:10 AM
then yeah he should be banned
but if he added him on the spot
then idk
wait
 
MinceToday at 12:11 AM
its a very fragile reason to ban someone
 
JakaToday at 12:11 AM
If he added him on the spot while it was happening, then it's the same.
imo just reset his progress for the period he was with the guy and unban him
 
interrobangToday at 12:12 AM
nevermind
they have been friends for 200 days
that shoobies guy is an alt
https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198094408358
main account
 
theAgamer11Today at 12:12 AM
welp that answers that
 
interrobangToday at 12:12 AM

217 days
they've been friends
https://steamid.uk/profile/76561198087579882
 
gettysburgToday at 12:12 AM
yikes
 
interrobangToday at 12:13 AM
so they coordinated it
case closed I say
 
MinceToday at 12:13 AM
though i guess it does matter more in MM
 
interrobangToday at 12:14 AM
so is this done? keep him banned?
 
gettysburgToday at 12:14 AM
yeah
 
MinceToday at 12:14 AM
its pretty sketch but i still dont like it
but w/e
 
gettysburgToday at 12:15 AM
if it was a recent add then he shoulda been unbanned but
over 200 days and he lied about it lol
 
MinceToday at 12:15 AM
yea
how do we know the two accounts are connected again?
the alt and main
if theyre just friends that doesnt really prove anything
 
interrobangToday at 12:18 AM
they're both named shoobies
also a third account named shoobies
https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198975955425
or was
https://steamcommunity.com/id/purplemist/stats/TF2
also mained sniper
 
BraindawgToday at 12:19 AM
both should get got
 
interrobangToday at 12:21 AM
is he actually claiming he coincidentally ran into his friend's cheating alt account and didn't know it was him
 
gettysburgToday at 12:22 AM
:shrug:
 
MinceToday at 12:27 AM
tell frigh to stop emoji spamming
 
gettysburgToday at 12:27 AM
can someone put lightning gunne in a dumpster so he stops reacting
shutup mince i thought of it first
 
interrobangToday at 12:30 AM
@Prejudge  final judgement
is he staying banned
 
JakaToday at 12:30 AM
banned him from reacts
 
interrobangToday at 12:30 AM
so we can just ban this guy from the discord
 
BraindawgToday at 12:30 AM
delet
 
interrobangToday at 12:31 AM
if we ban him don't delete his messages
 
JakaToday at 12:31 AM
log it :smirk:
 
gettysburgToday at 12:31 AM
i mean he knew he was cheating so
 
MinceToday at 12:33 AM
he healed the cheater right?
 
gettysburgToday at 12:33 AM
да
 
interrobangToday at 12:35 AM
he was friends with the cheater's main, added his alt account, and had him cheat in the campaign for him
 
MinceToday at 12:38 AM
see the shit storm this causes tho
doubt it will happen again but still
 
interrobangToday at 12:40 AM
it doesn't matter, if you collaborate with a friend to have him cheat for you, you should be banned.
or else it's a loophole
 
gettysburgToday at 12:51 AM
another idea
can we just not allow reactions in help_support
 
JakaToday at 12:52 AM
done
 
interrobangToday at 12:55 AM
bonus points
the guy is a steamrep scammer
https://steamrep.com/search?q=76561198087579882
 
MinceToday at 12:58 AM
yea once the evidence started piling up in terms of lying and all that jazz I agreed with you, but i just didnt like the "well ur friends with him" being the only justification
