it is satire
 
SntrToday at 9:31 PM
lol fuck off
 
Polish GuyToday at 9:32 PM
wow, why are you so agressive?
in my opinion, you should be more proffesional
considering you are a manager of a massive team fortress 2 charity event
 
SntrToday at 9:33 PM
I've heard too many people use "it's satire" as an excuse for incredibly awful posts
 
Polish GuyToday at 9:33 PM
but it's a good excuse
a user should not be warned for satirical content
 
SntrToday at 9:34 PM
so you just admitted that you were using satire as an excuse to post weirdass shit
 
Polish GuyToday at 9:34 PM
it's not very weird
i'm not using it as an excuse to not get reported for asking an under aged girl for nudes, am I?

- No adult (18+/NSFW) content, explicit, or controversial messages.
this here's the dealbreaker
Polish GuyToday at 9:35 PM
yes, I know that
 
SntrToday at 9:35 PM
and that cum post of yours definitely falls under here
 
Polish GuyToday at 9:35 PM
but there is nothing about satirical content there
 
SntrToday at 9:35 PM
hence the warning
that post of yours is not satire
you even said as much earlier
 
Polish GuyToday at 9:35 PM
what do you mean?
it is satire
 
SntrToday at 9:36 PM
I don't think you understand what satire means
 
Polish GuyToday at 9:37 PM
satire

    n.
    A literary work in which human foolishness or vice is attacked through irony, derision, or wit.
    n.
    The branch of literature constituting such works.
 
SntrToday at 9:37 PM
I was expecting to hear you use your own words than just copypaste what a search engine gives you
but your post still doesn't fall under satire
 
Polish GuyToday at 9:37 PM
it does
 
SntrToday at 9:38 PM
in any case, this yuh-huh nuh-uh isn't going anywhere
 
Polish GuyToday at 9:38 PM
yea
it's just a loop
I say: "its satire" and then you say: "its not satire"
 
SntrToday at 9:39 PM
but I will entertain this with only one question:
Explain, in your own words, how does your shitposting about big chungus qualify as satire
 
Polish GuyToday at 9:39 PM
because it falls under the definition of irony
 
SntrToday at 9:40 PM
well you should be aware of that popular phrase
ironical shitposting is still shitposting
 
Polish GuyToday at 9:41 PM
yes
