Somehow still alive.
Up to their usual bullshit.
Fine. Not good, but not bad.

Needs a medic bag.

Let me consult my magic 8 ball...... *Ask again later*.
I don't know who or what that is, but it's going in my cringe compilation now.
I'm not in the mood for this right now.
Sometimes I wonder if the world is a cruel place because it allows these things to exist.
About as useless as awards on steam reviews.
Hang on, I need to update my localization files first.
